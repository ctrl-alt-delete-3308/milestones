## Project Milestone 5 Next Up

Michael couldn't attend.

Rhett, Ryan, Kenny went over current site functionality, talked about remaining obstacles. Next big one is getting a live version of the site up.

## TODO List:
* For Ryan - get site hosted fully.
* For Rhett - about us page
* For Kenny - new feature
* add past searches to user account page. (I would love to have the past searches plus their positive, negative, and neutral scores displayed on the account page, but we would have to start saving those to our database and then access theem on the user page. None of that has been done.)
* redo the "About Pulse" page so it doesn't look like trash.
* start testing site (try to break it, then fix) (can never do too much)


## Was completed:
* Format search bar on home page. [rhett]
* format text on search results page. [rhett]
* start testing site (try to break it, then fix) [rhett]
* Rhett and Ryan completed Project Milestone 5

## Regarding Django

* Need to install to run: python3, django, crispy_forms, tweepy, textblob
* To create superuser (admin access): python3 manage.py createsuperuser to access admin site, once hosted add '/admin' to end of URL. Text Rhett your username and he can add a tab for you for easy access.
* to run server: python3 manage.py runserver
* url for site will be listed in terminal after running server, but should be: 'http://localhost:8000/'
